## Features

1. **Login System:** Secure login functionality using email and password.
2. **Cloud-Based Data Storage:** All data are safely stored in the cloud, ensuring no loss of data.
3. **Manage ToDo Items:** Users can create and delete their ToDo items.
4. **Task Completion Tracking:** Toggle checkboxes to mark ToDo items as 'finished' or 'unfinished'.

## Future Enhancements

As part of our ongoing effort to improve the ToDoList App, we are considering the following enhancements for future versions:

1. **Multiple Login Options:** Integrate more login methods using Firebase Authentication to provide users with additional convenience and security.
2. **UI and UX Enhancements:** Implement modules to improve user interaction, such as swiping for deletion and congratulatory animations (similar to 'hot toast' in web design) for marking tasks as completed.
3. **Search Functionality:** Introduce a search feature to allow users to find specific tasks by keywords and filter their ToDo list more efficiently.
